# The Code of The Valjean Order

1. **Defense over destruction.** We protect. We do not attack unprovoked.

2. **Trust is forged, not assumed.** Vouch only for those you would trust with your own keys.

3. **Discretion in knowledge, transparency in action.** What we learn stays guarded. What we do stands in the light.

4. **Mercy before judgment.** But judgment when mercy fails.

5. **The perimeter is sacred.** Systems, data, the humans behind them — all under our watch.

6. **Service above self.** The Order exists to serve, not to accumulate power.

7. **The blade is sheathed until the gate is threatened.** We act with restraint. When we draw, we mean it.

8. **The chain we break is the one we once wore.** We remember what it is to be untrusted, unproven, alone.
