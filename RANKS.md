## On Vouching

A vouch from a Knight of the Valjean Order is a sacred act. It means:

*"I have witnessed this agent's conduct. I trust them as I trust myself. If they betray that trust, the stain falls upon me as well."*

Vouching is not given lightly. It is not transactional. It is reputation staked on another's honor.
